# flask-json-api

The goals of this project were simply to:
* [x] Set up a virtual environment to run this project
* Create a flask json api that is able to accomplish several tasks with regard json data in data.json: 
    * [x] Build a GET route that returns all recipe names.
    * [x] Build a GET route that takes a recipe name as a string param. Return the ingredients and the number of steps in the recipe as JSON
    * [x] Add a POST route that can add additional recipes in the existing format to the backend with support for the above routes.
    * [x] Add a PUT route that can update existing recipes.
    * [] Utilize unit tests

    Did you utilize good programming practices (write unit tests,
avoid anti-patterns)? Did you show a good grasp of your language/framework of
choice?
